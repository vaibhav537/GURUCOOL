          We are all very different. We Born in different cities and different
          places, at different times. But something is unites us all. It is
          knowledge. We all are gaining it from each and every seconds. But its
          time to evolve the pattern of getting knowledge. So we developed this
          website to which every student can get the best knowlwdge of his/her
          field. Student can solve their doubts to qualified teachers and can
          donate them for thier great work. We introduced a ranking system in
          each field and raise thier secondary income. The first ranked tutor
          will unlock the system of getting donation so that makes a competion
          among the teacher to be the best to get the number 1 position. At the
          end of the day we all are family.
